    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What This Guides Microsite Is (and Isn’t)</h2>
      <p>
        This minisite does not rank or recommend specific cards. Instead, it explains 
        the moving parts behind credit cards in simple, structured language — so you can later use 
        <strong>Choose.Creditcard</strong> and its sub-hubs with more confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Concepts like APR, “0% intro offers”, no-foreign-fee branding, airport lounge access, travel insurance and 
        reward currencies are often marketed with slogans. Here, the goal is to describe how they actually work, 
        where the fine print sits, and what trade-offs might matter for your situation.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        Educational only. Nothing here is financial advice or a recommendation to apply for any particular card.

      <h2>How to Use This Knowledge in Practice</h2>
      <p>
        The goal is not for you to memorize formulas, but to recognize which card details actually change your 
        real-world cost or value: FX fees on each trip, insurance gaps, how quickly you earn rewards, 
        and how your credit profile might evolve.
      </p>
      <p>
        A simple way to move forward:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Read the guide that matches your current question (APR, travel, rewards, credit score).</li>
        <li>Open the relevant hub on Choose.Creditcard (Travel, Rewards, Credit Score, Technology, etc.).</li>
        <li>Compare cards using those concepts, rather than only marketing slogans or signup bonuses.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        Over time, more guides and card data will be added. The structure is built first so that future content slots in cleanly.
